make a search function so teams can get a list of all their matches and the times etc
have an array containing each object and use the search method (probably sequential as binary compares numbers) to find the name of the team
Then have it display all the data
  - each object will have internal arrays holding match times, location, etc
  - one 2d array [a][b],
      - a (first slot): number of matches
      - b (second slot): time, location, opponent, date (4 slots) 
      
      
      - SHOULD DATE BE IN A AS IT IS THE MATCH NUMBER ?? 
          - HAVE AN ARRAY OF MATCH DATES AND CONVERT MATCH NUMBER TO THE MATCH DATE ???
