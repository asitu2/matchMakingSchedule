Class: Random
SubClass: Opponent
Variables:
  - array of team
  - pref/no pref
  - array of used
  - array of teamname ??? <-- to randomize can we not just use array of team 
  - number of teams
Functions:
  -  getTeamInfo
  - getTeamNum <-- can be combined with team info (just use array length)
  - prefRand <-- NEEDED????
  - normRand
  
  prefRand/normRand <-- store results in used (where switching between eachoterh, store it in use so know which teams already have opponents)
        
  NOTE: FOR SUBCLASS OPPONENT STORE OPPONENTS IN AN ARRAY CALLED PREVOPP, SO THERE ARE NO REPEATS WHEN DOING A NOTHER MATCH
    - PREV OPP WOULD BE AN ARRAY IN THE TEAM CLASS
  
  NOTE 2: DOES RANDOMIZATION FOR OPPONENTES NEED PREF RRAND, CAUSE THERE IS NO PREFERANCES ????
