NOTE: HAVE TO CHECK PREFERENCES TO PARKS AS IF WRONG NAME IS INPUTTED OR PARK IS INVALID THAN IT CANNOT BE USED AND WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
  THIS MEANS THAT PARKS MUST BE THE FIRST THING IN THE FILE ???
  USE SEARCH FUNCTION FOR FIRST PARKS AND THE INPUT THE DATA AFTER THAT WORD FIRST THEN GO DO TEAMS ???
